A BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a simple yet useful tool designed to assess an individual's body weight in relation to their height, providing a general indication of whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The BMI is calculated using the formula:
BMI= weight(Kg)/Height(m^2)
In this Python-based BMI calculator, users input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in Centimers), we are converting the centimetervalue into meter value by diving 100, and the program computes their BMI. Based on the resulting BMI value, the tool categorizes the individualâ€™s weight status according to standard BMI ranges:
BMI<=16.0---> Severly UnderBMI
BMI<=18.0---> UnderBMI
BMI<=24.9---> NormalBMI
BMI<=29.9---> OverBMI
BMI<=34.9---> Moderately Obese
BMI<=39.9---> Severly Obese
This calculator serves as a quick and easy way for individuals to determine if their weight is within a healthy range. However, it is important to note that BMI does not account for other factors like muscle mass, bone density, or distribution of fat, which can affect health. Therefore, while it can offer valuable insights, it should not be used as a sole diagnostic tool. The Python program can be further extended with features like unit conversion, input validation, or a graphical interface for improved user experience.
